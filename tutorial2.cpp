#include<iostream> //iostream is the header file that helps to take input and give output //
int main() { 
  //int is the interger type , main() is the function //

  
  std::cout<<"Hello , I am a C++ Learner with the aim to solve 1000+ Leetcode problems  and crack MAANG "; 

  // in this line , "std" is the namespace and " :: " is the scope resolution and " cout << " is a function that is used to give the output ; "Hello World" is a output string ;

  return 0 ; 
  
  // return 0 is the return type of int main() function and it returns 0 when the program is compiled successfully //
